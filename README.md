# Spacy-Tokenization

üîç Excited to share my recent NLP assignment on Spacy Tokenization! üöÄ

I've been diving into the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), and I wanted to apply my skills to a practical project. For this assignment, I focused on Spacy, a powerful Python library for NLP tasks.

In this project, I created a blank language object and used it to tokenize words in a sentence. Tokenization is the process of breaking text into individual units called tokens, and it forms the foundation for many NLP tasks. I explored various features of tokenization, such as indexing for grabbing specific tokens, spanning for extracting subtexts, and token attributes for accessing information like part-of-speech tags and lemma.

One interesting task I tackled was collecting emails from a student information sheet. By leveraging Spacy's tokenization capabilities, I was able to efficiently extract email addresses from unstructured text, making data processing a breeze.

To broaden the scope of my project, I also experimented with supporting Urdu language. Spacy's multilingual capabilities allowed me to tokenize Urdu text, enabling me to analyze and extract information from this beautiful language as well.

Furthermore, I delved into customizing the tokenizer to suit specific requirements. I explored different tokenization strategies and fine-tuned the tokenizer to handle domain-specific jargon and abbreviations more effectively. This customization enhanced the accuracy and relevance of subsequent NLP tasks.

Another aspect I covered was sentence tokenization. Using Spacy, I implemented a sentence tokenizer to split paragraphs into individual sentences. This enabled me to analyze text at a more granular level, facilitating tasks such as sentiment analysis and summarization.

Overall, this NLP assignment on Spacy Tokenization was an enriching experience. It allowed me to gain hands-on expertise in tokenization techniques, language support, customization, and extracting valuable information from text.

I'm looking forward to further exploring the vast field of NLP and applying my newfound knowledge to exciting real-world projects. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you'd like to discuss NLP or related topics!
